The End of a School Day

The siren wails to mark the end of the day. There is excitement everywhere as 
the pupils abandon their tasks to embrace their  newly found freedom. The teacher's plea
for order falls on deaf ears as the burst of excitement is irresistible. The teacher 
resignedly packs his teaching material and heads for the staff room.

Meanwhile, commotion reigns in the classroom the teacher has just left. The sporadic 
loud banging of desks is heard as the pupils carelessly pack their belongings. Those that 
have completed packing form a stream that leads out towards the school grounds. Here part of
the stream continues towards gate while the remainder fans out onto the field. 

On the field they assemble into small groups bound by common interest. Some are seen 
arguing excitedly about sporting activities while others discuss school matters. Others 
still chase each other in cat and mouse fashion oblivious of the punishment they are inflicting
on their shoes which are not designed to withstand such vigorous activity.

After several minutes, even those that have remained in the fields sense the potential danger of 
walking home late so another stream naturally begins as the various groups start for the gate. 
Upon their exit there is further splitting as each one gets on their way home.

The School Trip

It was towards the end of the year when our school head, Ms Mutize, made an announcement on the the educational 
trip that the school was arranging for pupils. The news brought excitement to everyone as this 
provided a chance to break away from the boredom of boarding school confinement.

The plan was to go to Harare where we would visit some of the most exciting places in the city. Our 
parents were notified about the plan. They got SMS messages outlining the proposed dates for the trip 
and the payment required per child. A payment deadline was also set so that there would be enough time 
left for hiring the bus and buying the required materials.

I was overjoyed when I learnt that my parents had paid for me as soon as they had received the notice.
The number of paid students gradually increased as the payment deadline approached. At one point there 
were fears that there might not be enough students funded for the trip. Such a situation would lead to
cancellation of the trip which would cause great disappointment to those that had already paid. There 
was, however, a boom in payments in the week leading to the payment deadline. We were thrilled when we heard this 
news.

The school administration then proceeded to hire the bus and book visiting times with all the organisations 
that we had targeted to visit. These targeted sites included the National Museum, Robert Mugabe International Airport, 
and the Heroes Acre. We were all pleased with this selection. The school head finally announced that all 
the preparations had been completed. After this announcement, time ticked slowly towards the date of departure.

Rivers

Rivers are among the most captivating natural features one will come across. They also have great significance 
to life as they influence the life patterns of both people and animals.

Human settlement and habitation hinges on water availability so rivers naturally play an active role in this 
area. It is common for people to settle along a river course as this makes their survival and that of their
livestock easy. Agricultural activities can also be easily supported.

Rivers can also be very useful as transport channels. Many rivers worldwide are used by canoes and boats to 
transport people and goods upstream or downstream as needed. River transport is not commonly used in some 
countries due to several reasons. Firstly, natural features such as rapids and waterfalls make navigation hazardous.
In addition, siltation also make rivers impassable.

Countries also make grand plans that are supported by existing rivers. Industrial location is quite often 
determined by the courses of major rivers. The construction of dams across these rivers give them added significance
and the benefits are automatically multiplied. Large fisheries that provide a lot of jobs are born. Food 
processing industries grow as a result.

However, if rivers are not well maintained they can be a serious danger to communities. Dumping industrial waste in 
rivers, for example, can cause death to animals and humans that come into contact with it. Biological waste in rivers 
on the other hand leads to deadly diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

The Gems of Zimbabwe

The Gems of Zimbabwe are the Zimbabwe senior national netball team. In 2019, the Gems brought happiness to a lot of Zimbabwean
citizens by qualifying for the Netball World Cup. 

The tournament was hosted by England. All matches were played in the city of Liverpool. A total of sixteen 
teams were participating. Zimbabwe was one of the four African countries alongside Malawi, South Africa and Uganda.
Four groups each comprising four teams were formed. The teams in each group were to play each other on a round robin 
basis. All except the last team in each group would proceed to play further matches which could earn them the title.
The bottom teams in each group, however, would be placed in their own group which would enable them to be ranked from 
positions 13th to 16th.

Zimbabwe came second in their group of four which enabled them to advance to the next stage. They played very well and 
earned themselves great wins along the way. This was despite their height disadvantage as they had some of the shortest 
players at the tournament. The Gems eventually finished as number eight and were handsomely rewarded for their effort.
They also won themselves a lot of supporters. After the tournament, some of the players managed to secure contracts with 
high-ranked professional clubs. A lot of hope has been generated for the next tournament to be held in South Africa in 2023.

The tournament was eventually won by New zealand who defeated Australia in the final.

The Ill Woman

Chipo sat on a stool looking at her frail mother as she lay on the straw mat. Tears began to soak in her eyes as 
she stared pitifully at her only surviving parent. She looked so helpless and Chipo wished she could do something 
to help her ailing mother. She tried hard to devise a plan that could bring her mother back to normal health. However, 
at the back of her mind, she was convinced she was even more helpless than the patient.

Two weeks earlier, her mother had begun complaining about weaknesses in her joints accompanied by a stupefying dizziness.
Sarah had suggested that she go to the clinic but her mother had rejected the idea. Instead, she had sent Sarah to call
her elderly colleague who lived across the river. She had promptly responded to the call. She came and examined her junior 
friend with such fervour that Sarah was momentarily convinced her mother would get well soon. Her mother was asked all 
kind of questions in order to detemine the cause and subsequent cure for the illness. The elderly friend had gone back 
to her place and then returned with some herbs in a polythene bag.

Since that day, her mother had been retricted to only basic household tasks such as cooking and sweeping the hut and 
cooking meals. Fetching water and firewood had become Sarah's responsibilities as her mother was too weak to carry them out.
Her health gradually deteriorated such that after a fortinight she could hardly move. She realised that feeling sorry for her 
mother and herself would not solve anything but would only worsen the situation. She watched her mother fall asleep. She 
then quietly covered her with a light blanket before creeping out and closing the door.

She had made up her mind to go and inform his uncle who stayed half a dozen kilometres away from their homestead. Her 
mother'sat illness was such a confusing matter for children of her age. She had decided to act against her mother's will 
as she could not think about any solution on her own. The uncle would know better even though he and her sister were such 
fierce enemies.

The Storm

Time was approaching mid afternoon and the sun shone brightly on the plain. We were taking care of our herd of cattle.
It was the middle of the summer season so it was necessary to control the movement of animals in order to
protect the crops that were in the fields.

We observed a heap of white fluffy clouds was quickly building up on the eastern horizon. After a while, the mass of clouds
turned into a deep grey colour. Sporadic flashes of lightning accompanied by thunder were seen. In no time, the rain  was 
upon us. It was accompanied by gusty winds which blew westwards. This had the undesired effect of driving the cattle in that 
direction. My colleagues and I tried to establish a wall to block them. The cattle were, however, too forceful for a mere three 
bodies and we were overpowered. The cattle drove us backwards until we were in a maize field.

At this point, we realised there was no way we could push them back to the plain. Then it dawned on me that the western 
direction was actually the way home so we just drove the cattle in that direction, disregarding any crop fields in our way. 
We were fortunate that the wind maintained its direction which made it easy to drive the cattle. By the time we had reached home, 
we had passed through over half a dozen crop fields. There was serious damage to some of the crop but we could not help it.

We quickly drove the cattle into the kraals and went home. We sat by the fireside, shivering vigorously as we were 
drenched to the bone. Our goal for now, was to get warm. Tomorrow, would bring its new challenge of answering for our 
misdemeanour.

Communal Work

The damage to the main road at Rwanga Bridge was becoming a major concern for everyone. The heavy rains 
that had fallen the previous season had resulted in the river breaking its banks and wiping away a significant 
portion of the road. Consequently, the road had become impassable for cars and small vans. Only buses and lorries 
could painstakingly negotiate the newly formed gulleys and successfully pass on.

After numerous discussions, the villagers approached the district council offices to alert the authorities of
the damage to the road. The officers aknowledged the report but highlighted that they did not have sufficient 
human resources to carry out the work. The council could, however, provide the machinery that was required,  the 
workers to operate the machinery, and a few experienced manual labourers to give guidance to the villagers. The 
villagers would have to perform most of the manual work.

The work was scheduled to start two weeks after the visit to the council offices. The time between the visit and 
and the set starting date was used to plan and prepare for the work. The experienced council workers educated 
the villagers on how the work was to be done. Safety issues were also discussed so that the risk of accidents would 
be reduced. For example, the villagers were advised that smoking was forbidden at the site of the works as 
the habit could cause a fire outbreak. In addition, the villagers were taught about the safety clothing that they 
were to use and how they would put it on.

When the work finally started, the villagers worked with remarkable enthusiasm. They worked in teams on most of the tasks.
Guidance was provided by the experienced council workers. After a period of two weeks, the bridge was completed and 
the road became passable again. The villagers felt extremely proud as they marvelled at their work.
